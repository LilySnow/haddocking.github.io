In this page you can find links to our educational material, namely tutorials on the usage of our software and material for courses we teach at Utrecht University.

## Courses

* [**Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling**](/education/molmod/): A MSc course aimed at those interested in learning homology modelling, molecular simulation, and docking of biological molecules. All the material is freely available on our Github repository and makes use of Vagrant/Virtualbox.


## Research projects

We offer various [research projects](/education/research-projects/) to both bachelor and master students, all centered around our main research area: the development of reliable bioinformatics and computational approaches to predict, model and dissect biomolecular interactions at atomic level. Read more [here](/education/research-projects/).


## Conferences and workshops

* [Fall meeting of the Netherlands Society for Biomolecular Modelling - November 2016](/news/NSBM-fall-meeting)

* [INSTRUCT practical course: Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data - April 2016](/education/INSTRUCT-practical-course/)


## Tutorials

* [**HADDOCK basic protein-protein docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of the HADDOCK web server to model a protein-protein complex using interface information derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation data.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK MS cross-links tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK-Xlinks):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of cross-linking data from mass spectrometry to guide the docking in HADDOCK. 
  This tutorial builds on our [DisVis tutorial](/education/disvis-webserver/) and illustrates various scenarios of using 
  cross-linking data in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK ab-initio, multi-body symmetrical docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK-CASP-CAPRI-T70):
  A tutorial demonstrating multi-body docking with HADDOCK using its ab-initio mode with symmetry restraints.
  It is based on a former CASP-CAPRI target (T70).

* [**HADDOCK ligand binding site tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK-binding-sites):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of HADDOCK in ab-initio mode to screen for potential ligand binding sites. 
  The information from the ab-initio run is then used to setup a binding pocket-targetet protein-ligand docking run.
  We use as example the multidrug exporter AcrB.

* [**PowerFit tutorial**](/education/powerfit/): A small introduction into
  PowerFit to automatically place a high-resolution atomic structure in a
  lower-resolution cryo-electron microscopy density map.

* [**PowerFit web server tutorial**](/education/powerfit-webserver/): A small introduction into
  PowerFit to automatically place a high-resolution atomic structure in a
  lower-resolution cryo-electron microscopy density map making use of our [web portal](http://milou.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/POWERFIT) 
  (does not require Linux).

* [**DisVis web server tutorial**](/education/disvis-webserver/): A small introduction into
  DisVis to analyse the interaction space between two molecules from a set of restraints. It can help to filter out putative 
  false positive restraints and predict key residues involved in the interaction from this set of restraints. 
  It makes use of our [web portal](http://milou.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/POWERFIT) (does not require Linux).

* [**Template-derived pairwise distance restraints to guide docking tutorial**](/education/CACA-guided/): A tutorial 
  demonstrating the use of template-based pairwise distance restraints to guide HADDOCK docking process. This tutorial makes
  use of two web servers: 1) [PS-HomPPI v2.0](http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/PSHOMPPIv2.0/) and 2) [HADDOCK](https://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/).
